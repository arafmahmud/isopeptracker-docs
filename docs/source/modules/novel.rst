Novel Isoform Analysis
======================

Identify and characterize novel peptides from alternative splicing.

The Novel module identifies and characterizes novel peptides that arise from
alternative splicing events. These peptides may not be present in canonical
protein databases but could have important biological functions.

Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Novel peptide identification from alternative splicing events
* BLASTP integration for functional annotation
* Comparison with known peptide sequences
* Novel peptide characterization and properties

BLASTP Annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The module uses BLASTP to search novel peptides against protein databases to:

* Identify similar known proteins
* Predict potential functions
* Assess evolutionary conservation
* Determine functional domains

Workflow
~~~~~~~~

1. Input alternative splicing events or transcripts.
2. Generate novel peptides from splicing variations.
3. Run BLASTP analysis for functional prediction.
4. Review annotated novel peptides.
5. Export results for further analysis.

Output
~~~~~~

The module provides:

* List of novel peptides with their sequences
* BLASTP alignment results
* Functional annotations
* Peptide properties and characteristics
