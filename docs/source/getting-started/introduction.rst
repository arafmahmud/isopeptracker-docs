What is IsoPepTracker?
----------------------

IsoPepTracker is a powerful bioinformatics tool designed to visualize alternative splicing events, map peptides to genomic coordinates, and compare protein isoforms at the peptide level. The tool provides four main modules for comprehensive peptide and splicing analysis.

Purpose
-------

IsoPepTracker enables researchers to:

* Analyze canonical peptides across different transcript isoforms
* Identify novel peptides arising from alternative splicing events
* Search for specific peptides across comprehensive databases
* Visualize alternative splicing events and their impact on peptide generation

Target Audience
---------------

This tool is designed for:

* Bioinformatics researchers working with RNA-seq data
* Proteomics scientists studying isoform-specific peptides
* Computational biologists analyzing alternative splicing
* Researchers investigating novel peptides and their functions

Getting Started
---------------

To begin using IsoPepTracker:

1. Visit the `web application <https://isopeptracker.org>`_
2. Choose the appropriate module for your analysis
3. Follow the module-specific workflows described in this documentation
