IsoPepTracker Documentation
============================

Welcome to IsoPepTracker, an interactive peptide visualizer for alternative splicing analysis. It provides a comprehensive platform for analyzing peptides across transcript isoforms, identifying novel peptides from alternative splicing events, and visualizing splicing impacts on the proteome.

.. note::
   IsoPepTracker is a powerful bioinformatics tool designed to visualize alternative splicing events, map peptides to genomic coordinates, and compare protein isoforms at the peptide level.

Quick Start
-----------

IsoPepTracker provides four main modules for comprehensive peptide and alternative splicing analysis:

* **Canonical**: Analyze canonical peptides across isoforms with three analysis modes
* **Novel**: Identify and characterize novel peptides from alternative splicing
* **Peptide Search**: Search for specific peptides across the database  
* **Alternative Splicing**: Visualize and analyze alternative splicing events

Key Features
------------

* Interactive peptide visualization across transcript isoforms
* Novel peptide identification from alternative splicing events
* Comprehensive peptide search functionality
* Support for multiple proteases and miscleavage settings
* Integration with rMATS and SplAdder for splicing analysis
* BLASTP annotation for functional prediction
